Our repository includes a folder labelled as Assignment1. In this folder, there are source files that implement an abstract factory method and a general factory method to create grocery products and set the prices of grocery products. The prices of the grocery products are read from a txt. file within the directory. Apple and Banana factories were created to encapsulate these products and ehance the quality of our software design by applying the Open-Closed Principle. Furthermore, we have a test class that proves the results of our factory method designed program. It creates a Banana Product and an Apple Product using GroceryProduct and GroceryProductFactory properties and reads the prices from a database text file. Moreover, we have a folder that contains the UML Design Diagram for our factory method design pattern implementation.


Below is the screen dump of our succesful test results for this program.
